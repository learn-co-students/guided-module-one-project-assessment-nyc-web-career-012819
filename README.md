Module One Final Project
========================

This is my first Command Line Application.

It consists of

1. Three models with corresponding tables, including a join table.
2. Accesses a Sqlite3 database using ActiveRecord.
3. Has a CLI that allows users to interact with your database as defined by my _user stories

#### Setup

* In the main directory, I've got a `Gemfile` that gives me access to `activerecord`, `pry`, `rake`, and `sqlite3`.
  * Remember to `bundle install`!
* In the `bin` directory, you've got a `run.rb` file that you can run from the command line with `ruby bin/run.rb.`
* In `config`, I've got my database set up with Active Record, as well as all of my models from the `lib` folder made available to your database.


Run ruby bin/run.rb and follow the commands.

Enjoy!
